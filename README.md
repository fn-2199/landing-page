Project: Landing Page from TheOdinProject

This is the second project assigned by The Odin Project. We are to create a website that satisfies their guideline. I've tweaked it a bit and made it my own by replacing the placeholder content, adding images, and utilizing css libraries. This project tested all the skills I've learned so far in this course -- creating flexboxes, centering elements both vertically and horizontally, using the right set of selectors and combinators, and removing pre-defined styles from certain elements.

In addition, I added a couple of extra functionalities to the web page that I learned outside of the Foundations course. To increase the interactivity without the use of Javascript, I downloaded libraries using npm install and copied their min.css file to our main project's directory. This is crucial to ensure our animations work outside of our local system.
